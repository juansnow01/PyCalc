# PyCalc

## NEW REPO ALERT

A simple calculator using python..

It doesnt have a front end so you have to run it in a shell, but basically it runs in steps. 

1. Pick an action (add/subtact/multiply/divide)
2. pick a value
3. pick a second value

after it gives you the answer it will then ask you if you want to run some more numbers.

Its not pretty, but it's what I got for yall as of now!
